This project was made to allow the creation of customized nicknames for players on Minecraft Java Edition 1.16+ servers using [Essentials/EssentialsX](https://essentialsx.net/) and `/nick` <br>

If using the executable, no special considerations are needed, as JDK 8 is packaged with it. <br>
If using the `.jar` file, you will need to use JDK/JRE 8, and _must_ run the file using:
`java -jar BHB.jar`
