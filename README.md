⚠️ **This project is now deprecated, in favor of [/bhb-webapp/](https://github.com/DavidArthurCole/bhb-webapp/), which will eventually mimic this application in an HTML/JS App to minimize the necessity to download files. The web-app can be found [here](https://davidarthurcole.github.io/bhb-webapp/).** ⚠️

This project was made to allow the creation of customized nicknames for players on Minecraft Java Edition 1.16+ servers using [Essentials/EssentialsX](https://essentialsx.net/) and `/nick` <br>

Running on Windows:
- Download `BHB.exe` and run it
- Specific Java version is not required, as JDK 8 is packaged

Running on Mac OSx or Linux distros:
- Download and install [Java 8](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp) **Use version 8u291**
- Download `BHB.jar`
- `cd` to the location of the jar file. If you did not move the file, the command will likely be: `cd Downloads`. Otherwise, if you, for example, moved the file to your desktop, the command would be: `cd Desktop`
- Run BHB with `java -jar BHB.jar`
- **Linux only:** If you have multiple Java installations, you will need to [switch the active version](https://askubuntu.com/questions/740757/switch-between-multiple-java-versions) to Java 8
