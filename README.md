This project was made to customize nickname colors for Java Minecraft 1.16 servers using essentials and /nick (that support hex codes). <br>
Documentation is present [here](https://www.safesurvival.net/threads/hex-blender-gui-version.4829/).

If using the executable, no extra software is neccessary. <br>
If using the `.jar` file, you will need to use JDK/JRE 8, and _must_ run the file using:
`java -jar BHB.jar`
