This project was made to allow the creation of customized nicknames for players on Minecraft Java Edition 1.16+ servers using [Essentials/EssentialsX](https://essentialsx.net/) and `/nick` <br>

Running on Windows:
- Download `BHB.exe` and run it
- Specific Java version is not required, as JDK 8 is packaged

Running on Linux distros:
- Download and install [Java 8](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)
- Download `BHB.jar`
- If you have multiple Java installations, you will need to [switch the active version](https://askubuntu.com/questions/740757/switch-between-multiple-java-versions) to Java 8
- Run BHB with `java -jar BHB.jar`

Running on MacOSX:
- Download and install the [Java 8 JDK](https://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/8u311-b11/4d5417147a92418ea8b615e228bb6935/jdk-8u311-macosx-x64.dmg)
- Download `BHB.jar` (Optional: Move the file to a location other than Downloads)
- Open Terminal
- `cd` to the location of the jar file. If you did not move the file, the command will likely be: `cd Downloads`. Otherwise, if you, for example, moved the file to your desktop, the command would be: `cd Desktop`
- Run BHB with `java -jar BHB.jar`
